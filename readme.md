# Blockchain4EU - CareAi

### CareAi
CareAi is a future-looking installation aimed at creating discussion around ideas of:
 * _"What might healthcare look like on the blockchain?"_
 * _"What if we had free access to distributed healthcare databases?"_ 
 * _"How might one publicly share medical data publicly?"_ 
 * _"How might medical feedback be distributed through the blockchain?"_

This project is a collaborative effort of a few individuals:
* [Jordi Planas](http://vimod.net/en/)
* [Ideas For Change](https://www.ideasforchange.com/)
* [Gui Seiz](http://cargocollective.com/seiz)
* [And Myself](http://lucaslorenzopena.com/)


As part of a join project, in discovering the future of healthcare data ownership, we first need to understand what makes people share their data. For more info on this check out [Triem](https://www.ideasforchange.com/triem/).

### BlockChain4EU

The European Commission's [Joint Research Centre (JRC)](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/about/jrc-in-brief) and the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry,
Entrepreneurship & SMEs (DG GROW) have launched the project [#Blockchain4EU](https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain4eu?lang=en): Blockchain for Industrial
Transformations, running until February 2018. The project is a forward looking exploration of existing, emerging and
potential applications based on Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) for non-financial / industry
sectors.

It aims to identify, discuss and communicate possible uses and impacts of Blockchain and other DLT objects, networks and services within EU industrial or business contexts, from supply chains and assets monitoring, to intellectual property rights and authentication or certification. Its main outputs will contribute to explore future socio-technical scenarios of production, distribution and use, and assess risks and opportunities for development and uptake, with a key focus on SMEs and on innovation and competitiveness.
